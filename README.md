Super Mario Bros for the NES created in GameMaker to be as close as I could get it to the original 

Known issues:
- Jumping is not exactly like in the original, there should be more momentum in the jump allowing you to jump further to the right

Things that can be improved:
- Shaders should be used instead of using seperate sprites for each powerup and starpower
